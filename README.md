# Performance of Python Idioms
## Supplementary Document
performance_python_idioms_supplementary_document.pdf provides code examples of idiomatic code and non-idiomatic code on synthetic dataset and real-project datasetï¼Œthe detailed discussions on Stack Overflow about the performance of python idioms, the calculation of the number of code pairs for Python idioms, bytecode instructions of non-idiomatic code and idiomatic code for Python idioms.

## Data:
  1. Synthetic dataset and Real-project dataset are in data/two-datasets/
  2. Formative study: discussions on Stack Overflow about performance of nine Python idioms is in data/formative_study.csv
  
## Code:

   1. You could set the absolute path of project in the code1/util.py
   2. Performance measurement for synthetic dataset and real-project dataset are in code1/lab_performance/PythonIdiom/get\_\*\_time.py and code1/performance/get\_\*\_time.py
   3. plotting the distribution of performance change of nine Python idioms on two datasets is in the code1/rq1_boxplot.py
   4. Relationship between features and performance change in synthetic dataset and real-project dataset is in code1/lab_performance/PythonIdiom/analysis\_\*\_features.R and code1/performance/PythonIdiom/analysis\_\*\_features.R
